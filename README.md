# Stricker_Project---Python
In this project I analyzed  the performance of strikers using Python. It focuses on key metrics like avg goal scored,  strike rate, and consistency to identify top-performing left &amp; right footed players. The data is explored, cleaned, and visualized to uncover valuable insights using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
